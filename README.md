heavy-encypted-chat
===================

python encrypted chat based on an n seconds auto-changing encryption key. 


The goal  is to limit the avaibility of DPI technology owner to easily catch and decrypt the packet flow between two or more chatters. 

how it s done ?
With sharing an big list of timestampted keys then changing the key every n seconds.
In that way more long you want to decrypt, less affordable (& more expansive) is it.

This method force to allow brutforce-only method for decrypt content.

Some defaults are present:

- more you want to be secured more the key's lists are bigger
(if you want changing the key every 10 second you have to think about 4 Go/years for keys)

- the time/cost for the generation of keys 
it s relative to the key regeneration delta time

- the necessity that both devices use by chatter are safe 
If not: the bad people could get the list of keys then with some studies use it to decode the encrypted content in packet 
or read directly the clear text on harddrive.

- default relative to the consequence of sharing keys
 > the best way is to use usb drive/flash/sd/dvd to share hand by hand and person to person. (read only format like DVD or CD is better and more easy to destroy than hdd)
 > it is important to never share the key list by internet !!! 
    if you have no other solution, try to do it using (VPN) + SSH + HTTPS + (smart card) but don't use weak way like http seving or ftp or every other online hosting service

- default relative to NAT rules if you want to be able to receive content if you are behind a router 
(need to redirect port number 10000 to the chat machine)


The program is composed with a main program using 5 sub elements:

 - main program

sub elements:
  -1- a part to maintain the good timestamped key
  it serve the good key at the good moment for encrypt & decrypt content
  -2- a part for web-gui (based on html+jquery+json file)
  -3- a part for gui back office
   -3-1- part who update the json file with clear content receive
   -3-2- part who is subdiviside in 3 part
    -3-2-1- part who serve an http server to receive parameter from gui
    -3-2-2- part who serve an http server to receive encrypted data from remote server and decrypt
    -3-2-3 part who serve an http server to receive clear data then encrypt and send to remote server
  -4- a part for telecomunication beetween the differents 'gui-back-office' parts
  -5- a part for generating keys table lists to share with other chatter (required for encryption)
