heavy-encypted-chat
===================

python encrypted chat based on auto-changing key encryption every n seconds



The wish of this program is to limit the avaibility of DPI technology owner to easily catch and decrypt the flow of packet between two chatters. 

how it s done ?
With sharing an heavy list of timestampted key then changing the key every n seconds.
so more long you want to decrypt, less affordable (so more expansive) is it.

This method force to allow brutforce-only method for decrypt content.



Some default are present:

- more you want to be secured more the list of key is big
(if you want changing the key every 10 second you have to think about 4 Go/years for keys)

- the time/cost for generating keys lists 
it s relative to the key regeneration delta time

- the necessity that both device use by chatter are safe 
If not: the bad poeople could get all the key then with some studies use the stolen
key to decode the encrypted content in packet 
or 
read directly the clear text on harddrive

- default relative to the need to share an heavy list of timestamped key
> the best way is to use usb drive/flash/sd/dvd to share physically the key. (read only is better and easy to destroy)
> it is important to never share the key list by internet !!! if you have no other solution try using with (VPN) + SSH + HTTPS + (smart card) but don't use weak way like http seving or ftp or every other online hosting service

- default relative to NAT rule if you want to be able to receive content if you are behind a router 


The program is composed with a main program using 5 sub element:
 main program
 sub element:
  - a part to maintain the good timestamped key
   serve the good key at good moment for encrypt content to send or decrypt content to receive
  - a part for web-gui (based on html+jquery)
   web page with function which reload the content from a json file
  - a part for gui back office
   - part who update the json file with clear content receive
   - part who is subdiviside in 3 part
    - part who serve an http server to receive parameter from gui
    - part who serve an http server to receive encrypted data from remote server and decrypt
    - part who serve an http server to receive clear data then encrypt and send to remote server
  - a part for telecomunication beetween the different gui-back-office part
  - a part for generating key table required for enryption
